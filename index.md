#### Purpose
We are looking at data from Ice, an online retail store for video games. The data set includes categories based on genre, platform, rating, sales, release year, critic, and user scores.  

The purpose of this project is to collect historical data, and apply insights to determine whether a game will succeed or not in the future. These insights will be used to optimize capital allocation in regards to advertising potentially big winners. We will be determining total sales,  and the distribution  of sales across the different platforms. We will illustrate which platforms lead, and lag in sales. Data analysis will determine the most popular platforms and genres. Investigations will determine if the average user ratings of certain platforms are the same, or if the average ratings of certain genres are the same. 

#### Conclusions
Overall, we can look at our data to make predictions for 2017. First, inferences would need to be made as to the region we are most interested in marketing to. Since the North American region generally leads in sales, and since the European region follows a similar trend, we can maximize our results by focusing on North America. Since the most popular platform is the PS4, we will be looking for a game on that platform. Since the most popular genre in North America is action, we will be looking for the next big action game. Furthermore, we would want a game that could be played on XONE or PC as well, to maximize sales. Since ratings and user scores do not influence sales, we will not care too much about those factors. Yet, a game in the action genre will likely be M for mature. It is highly likely that the next iteration of Call of Duty or GTA will be widely successful. Alternatively, if we want to market to the Japanese region, we will look for a role playing game on the 3DS. However, profits are likely to be higher working with the previous strategy.

## Other Projects

Yandex-Music
First data science project, EDA
[Yandex Music](https://github.com/jodiambra/Yandex-Music/blob/main/Yandex%20Music%20Final.ipynb)

-  Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare the music preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. We will use data provided by Yandex.music to test hypotheses on user behavior.

Instacard-EDA
Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis
[Instacart EDA](https://github.com/jodiambra/Instacart-EDA/blob/main/Instacart%20EDA.ipynb)

-  Purpose
This project analyzes data collected by Instacart, the grocery delivery platform. The purpose of this project is to clean up the data, and use the cleaned data to report insights on shopping habits of Instacart customers. The data  was cleaned by removing duplicate vales, and filling in missing values, all while maintaining the integrity of the dataset. Analyses indicated the number of orders placed, dependent on variables such as time of the day, day of the week, and time since the customer last placed an order. The results demonstrate the distribution of the number of orders customers place, the top 20 products, and the top 20 reordered products. 


Megaline-Plus
[Megaline Plus Revenue](https://github.com/jodiambra/Megaline-Plus/blob/main/Megaline%20EDA.ipynb)

-  Purpose 
The purpose of this project remains to analyze the data provided by the telecom operator Megaline. With an offering of two plans, Surf and Ultimate, the goal of this project is to determine optimal capital allocation. We will determine which plan brings in more revenue. This will result in an adjustment of the advertising budget, as a means to further increase revenue. The dataset provided is a sample of the population of Megaline customers, across different cities in 2018. We will conduct further analysis on the client behavior, as well as look at other important insights found in the data.
